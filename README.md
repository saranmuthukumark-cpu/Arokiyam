- Health strictness modes (`Basic`, `Medium`, `Health conscious`) that control skip/snooze behavior.
- Manual quick actions for blink, break, hydration, and drink.
- Auto-start toggle and desktop notification controls.
- Cross-platform packaging and tag-based GitHub Release automation.

## Tech Stack

- Electron
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- `uiohook-napi` for global keyboard/mouse activity monitoring
- `electron-builder` for installers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## Release Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions to build and publish release assets.

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggered by tag push (`v*`) or manual dispatch.
- Publishes only user-facing assets:
  - `*-setup.exe`
  - `*.dmg`
  - `*.AppImage`
  - `*.deb`
- Automatically refreshes README download links after release.

### Version And Tag Commands

```bash
bun run release:patch
bun run release:minor
bun run release:major
```

These commands create a version bump commit (`vX.Y.Z`) and push tags.
